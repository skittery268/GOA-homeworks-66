      q1: {
        question: "How quickly can you turn over my property?",
        answer:
          "Most turnovers are completed within 3–4 hours of guest checkout. With a confirmed schedule, we can have your property guest-ready the same day — even for back-to-back bookings.",
      },
      q2: {
        question: "Which areas do you currently serve?",
        answer:
          "We operate across major Italian short-term rental markets including Rome, Florence, Milan, Naples and Venice, and we add new cities every quarter. Enter your address at booking to confirm coverage.",
      },
      q3: {
        question: "Do I need to be present for the cleaning?",
        answer:
          "No. The vast majority of our hosts use smart locks or key handoffs. We document entry and exit with timestamped photos, so you always have a record without lifting a finger.",
      },
      q4: {
        question: "How does pricing work?",
        answer:
          "You can pay per turnover or save with a managed monthly plan. Per-turnover pricing is based on property size and the services you select — there are no contracts and no hidden fees.",
      },
      q5: {
        question: "Are supplies and linens included?",
        answer:
          "You choose. We can use your supplies and linens, or provide hotel-grade linens and consumables as an add-on. Restocking is tracked automatically so you never run out.",
      },
      q6: {
        question: "Is there a cancellation fee?",
        answer:
          "Cancellations made more than 24 hours before a scheduled turnover are free. Inside 24 hours, a 50% fee applies to cover the reserved crew slot.",

        question: "What if I'm not satisfied with a clean?",
        answer:
          "Every turnover is backed by our Guest-Ready Guarantee. If something isn't right, we'll re-clean within 24 hours at no charge — or refund the visit.",

      q8: {
        question: "Are your cleaners vetted and insured?",
