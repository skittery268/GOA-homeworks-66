/**
 * The narrow centred card, for the screens that interrupt a flow: password
 * reset and the 2FA challenge.
 *
 * Sign-in and sign-up live in the `(auth-split)` group instead, which has no
 * layout of its own because each of those pages brings the split frame with it.
 * They are front doors and get the brand plane; a "your code expired" screen
 * behind a full marketing panel would read as a landing page.
 *
 * Route-group layouts are not part of the generated `LayoutRoutes` union, so
 * the props are typed directly rather than through the `LayoutProps` helper.
